#Goodbye Dad By @Leanne Brady | It's never the right time To say goodbye. I will miss you, Dad, And here is why. You taught me so much: To show no fear, To always have fun, And face the day with cheer.  You were always so able, So fast and so strong. In your little girl's eyes You could do no wrong. You would always listen, And you never pried. You were the arms around me When I cried.  You never looked for praises, And you were never one to boast. You were always there For those you loved the most.  You worked so hard, And those strong working hands Led me through life And helped me understand That life can be hard, And tough, and sad, But through it all I had my Dad.  And because of you, I understood That life was actually Pretty good. I believe in you And will follow your path, And when things go wrong, I'll look back and laugh.  I hope you can hear me So I can let you know That you were and will forever Be my superhero. So yes, today I am full of sorrow, But I will smile a little more With each tomorrow.  So please, Dad, go Be at rest And know to me You were always the best.  I love you so much and miss you every day! xxx
